<p>Background information: I was born and raised in Australia, my family is Australian for at least five generations in any direction. I am a nerd who is great at thinking logically and struggles to be creative. This is my first year of a Bachelor Degree in IT and RMIT.</p>
  <p>Fun fact: This is Mo. He is my dog and I love him immensely.</p>

  <h1>Interest in IT</h1>

<p>I have been interested in IT and programming since primary school, it really seemed to click with me because I was great at working through the steps to achieve what I wanted my code to do. My first experiences were with Scratch and Hopscotch, but I moved onto Visual Basic in high school and also enjoyed games like TIS-100 in my spare time.</p>
<p>I chose RMIT over other universities because it had IT in the name because it has great facilities and is only an hour away on public transport, compared to Swinburne for example which would be an extra half hour each way.</p>
<p>I’m hoping to get more familiar through my studies with things I hadn’t previously explored such as Python, Github, and HTML in general. I’m paying for a web domain in case I make cool things, and hopefully that fills up in the next few years.</p>



  <h1>Ideal Job</h1>

<p>I feel like a desk job would probably be right for me, and although I’m not yet certain I’m currently looking into data analysis as a career path.</p>

<p>The above job is located in Melbourne, which would make transportation easy. It has a pretty good salary, and also claims to have a “great cultural environment” which hopefully means it would be nice to work at.</p>
<p>It requires in-depth knowledge of software like Excel, SQL, and PivotTables, some of which I am not very familiar with. I’m pretty comfortable with Excel, but haven’t touched the others before. It also requires producing client data reports and high quality analytics, both of which I feel confident in my ability to do. My Bachelor Degree should teach me most of the remaining skills I required, and a few online courses would do the rest (perhaps Scrimba).</p>

  <br></br>

<p>Firstly, these tests were done while sleep-deprived, so the results may not be entirely accurate. That being said, most of the things I have done in the last year or so have been while sleep deprived, so somewhere down the line it should all cancel out.</p>
<p>The first result is kind of surprising, and not what I remember getting on this test previously. I feel like a few different personalities could apply to me here, so my actual results would depend on how I feel at the time. Although I would say many aspects of the ENFJ-T personality does fit me, I definitely don’t go out looking for leadership roles. Responsibilities stack up far too easily.</p>
<p>The visual learning style result isn’t too surprising, I tend to be able to pick things up just from reading about it and observing examples. Not much to say about that.</p>
<p>The Divergent Association Task results also aren’t too unexpected, I am very good at making connections that, well, are a bit of a stretch. It does help when brain-storming, but when it comes to artistic creativity and other types I’m pretty hopeless.</p>
<p>Despite what Myers-Briggs may say, in a group project I am not usually the one that volunteers myself to lead said group. Sometimes if I feel my group-mates aren’t confident I won’t shun the responsibility, but usually if someone else wants the role I’m happy to let them have it. The learning style test isn’t super relevant unless I need to be shown how to do something, but the high divergent association task results show that I’m an excellent help when it comes to brainstorming solutions to problems.</p>
<p>What this really boils down to is in a group project, I’m not one to ask to be the leader, but I’ll take it if it’s required. I’m good at team-work, and although I may struggle, I’ll do my absolute best to make sure I don’t let anyone else down. I also try to help with any problems people may have, even at my own expense.</p>
